Business Problem: Analyse bookshop sales using Python 
Objectives:
MISSION 1
1. Analysis of indicators and charts related to revenue
To start with, we'll examine the key performance indicators related to revenue:
Total revenue
Revenue by product or service
Revenue by region
Revenue growth
2. Evolution over time and decomposition with a moving average
To evaluate the overall revenue trend, we'll use a time series analysis:
Graph of monthly/quarterly revenue over a given period
Use of a moving average (e.g., a 3-month moving average) to smooth out seasonal variations and identify the overall trend.
3. Zoom in on references, top performers, underperformers, and distribution by category
For this part, we'll delve deeper into the analysis by exploring:
The top-performing and underperforming references
The distribution of revenue by product or service category
Comparison of performance between different categories

MISSION 2
1. A more targeted analysis of customer profiles.
Revenue distribution among customers using a Lorenz curve.
Examine certain correlations:
The link between the gender of customers and the categories of books purchased.
The link between customers' ages and the total amount of purchases, purchase frequency, average basket size, and categories of books purchased.
 
 
 
 
 Project-6
Analysis of bookshop sales:
- Filled missing data with zero.
- Joined the 3 csv. data files.
- Summarized the data into total sales by each categories, total profit and the best selling category.
- Checked for the outliers, normality, correlation coefficient, and caluclated zscores.
- Use bar plots for summaries, line graph for trends and scatter plot for relationships.
- Used Lorenz curve for Gini index
