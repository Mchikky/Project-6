Analyze bookstore sales with R or Python 

Objectives of the presentation

MISSION 1
1. Analysis of indicators and charts related to revenue
Examine the key performance indicators related to revenue:
Total revenue
Revenue by product or service
Revenue by region
Revenue growth
2. Evolution over time and decomposition with a moving average
To evaluate the overall revenue trend, use a time series analysis:
Graph of monthly/quarterly revenue over a given period
Use of a moving average (e.g., a 3-month moving average) to smooth out seasonal variations and identify the overall trend.
3. Zoom in on references, top performers, underperformers, and distribution by category
Delve deeper into the analysis by exploring:
The top-performing and underperforming references
The distribution of revenue by product or service category
Comparison of performance between different categories

MISSION 2
1. A more targeted analysis of customer profiles.
Revenue distribution among customers using a Lorenz curve.
2. Examine certain correlations:
- The link between the gender of customers and the categories of books purchased.
- The link between customers' ages and the total amount of purchases, purchase frequency, average basket size, and categories of books purchased.

 
Business Problem: 
Analyze bookstore sales with Python 

Project Scope: 
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Generation of graphics and visuals
- Insights and Recommendations

Data Preprocessing
- Imported 2 csv. data files (customers and products).
- Studied the data values, checked the columns and rows.
- Filled missing data with zero.
- Joined the 3 csv. data files.
   
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
- Summarized the data into total sales by each categories, total profit and the best selling category.
- Checked for the outliers, normality, correlation coefficient, and caluclated zscores.
   
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Calculate total revenus from products by region
   
Generation of graphics and visuals
- Use bar plots for summaries, line graph for trends and scatter plot for relationships.
- Used Lorenz curve for Gini index
